# Quantification-of-Reliability-of-future-Energy-Systems-with-a-high-share-of-renewable-generation-under-extreme-weather-effects

* The composition of the future EU elecricity energy system will change significantly in the next decades.
* The stochastic nature of weather based energy sources will play a major role in a future renewable energy supply. 
* Goal of this work is to point a view on reliability and cost efficiency of Energy systems with a high share of renewable penetration under extreme weather effects.
* Therefore a system of 18 EU countries is examined. 


## Actual Modelling framework
- Unit commitment  (UC)

## Future Modelling framework
- Dispatch investment model
- UC-chance constrained or robut optimization

## Reliability frameworks:
- Loss of load hours (LOLH)
- Expected energy not served (EENS)
- Loss of load probability (LOLP)

## Consideration: 
- Renewable elecricity resources like PV, wind, hydro & biomass
- Technical constraints like ramping times of conventional power plants
- Storages like battery, psp, reservoire
- NTC between the countries
- Future synthetic country based demand profiles (8760 h)
- Wind and PV generation capacity profiles (historically)
- Hydro generation potentials country wise
- Engineering risks (FOR)
