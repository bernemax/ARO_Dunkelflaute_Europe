# Quantification-of-Reliability-of-future-Energy-Systems-with-a-high-share-of-renewable-generation-under-extreme-weather-effects

* The composition of the future EU elecricity energy system will change significantly in the next decades.
* The stochastic nature of weather based energy sources will play a greater role in the future. 
* Goal of this work is to point a view on reliability and cost efficiency of Energy systems with a high share of renewable penetration under extreme weather effects.
* Therefore a system of 18 EU countries is examined.

*Modelling framework
- GEP  
- unit commitment  

*Reliability frameworks:
- loss of load hours (LOLH) and expected energy not served (EENS)

*Consideration: 
- renewable elecricity resources like PV, wind, hydro & biomass
- technical constraints like ramping times of conventional power plants
- storages like battery, psp, reservoire
- NTC between the countries
- future synthetic country based demand profiles (8760 h)
- wind and PV generation capacity profiles (historically)
- water availability country wise
- engineering risks (FOR)
