# Adaptive Robust Optimization for European Electricity System Planning Considering Regional Dunkelflaute Events 

This repository entails the capacity expansion model for a fully decarbonized European electricity system using an Adaptive Robust Optimization (ARO) framework. The model endogenously identifies the worst regional Dunkelflaute events, prolonged periods of low wind and solar availability, and incorporates multiple extreme weather realizations within a single optimization run. Furthermorethe deterministic counterpart is provided, which calculates capacity expansion based on an average weather year.

## Actual Modelling framework
- Deterministic
- Adaptive Robust Optimization 

## Consideration: 
- A system of 24 EU countries is examined
- Renewable elecricity resources like PV, wind-onshore, wind-offshore, hydro 
- Storages like battery, psp, reservoire, hydrogen
- High voltage electricity grid, DC OPF
- Future synthetic country based demand profiles
- Wind and PV generation capacity profiles (historically 40 Years)
- Hydro generation potentials country wise
