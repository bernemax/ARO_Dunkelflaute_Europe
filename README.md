# Effects of climate induced uncertainties on the future European electricity system

* The composition of the future EU elecricity energy system will change significantly in the next decades.
* The stochastic nature of weather based energy sources will play a major role in a future renewable energy supply. 
* Goal of this work is to point a view on reliability and cost efficiency of Energy systems with a high share of renewable penetration taking climate and weather conditions into account 
* We want to tackle the following questions: What makes a system robust - Which technology mix, Which uncertainties to consider? What are the extra cost of a robust system? What is a appropriate level of uncertainty which we need to take into account?  


## Actual Modelling framework
- Adaptive Robust Optimization

## Future Modelling framework
- Generation and transmission expansion
- DC optimal power flow

## Reliability frameworks:
- Loss of load hours (LOLH)
- Expected energy not served (EENS)
- Loss of load probability (LOLP)

## Consideration: 
- A system of 22 EU countries is examined
- Renewable elecricity resources like PV, wind-onshore, wind-offshore, hydro 
- Storages like battery, psp, reservoire, hydrogen
- High voltage electricity grid
- Future synthetic country based demand profiles
- Wind and PV generation capacity profiles (historically 40 Years)
- Hydro generation potentials country wise
